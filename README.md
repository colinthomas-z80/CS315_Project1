Simple ball throwing game by Colin Thomas

## Project Report
This final iteration I was able to spend time making the game more interesting/challenging. I wanted to make the pin float around so it is harder to hit. I think I captured the style of bowling alley animation pretty well with the little wings. One triumph of mine is that I am finally rid of the physics bug where the ball snapped back to its previous location. You really need to coax the engine to programatically move Rigid Bodies. The difficulties I had combined with examples of people warning against it on forums lead me to believe it isn't a very good practice. After I started instancing each ball I didn't have to move them programatically anymore.
