## Project Report
This first iteration I ran in to a lot of problems, as expected in learning a new technology. Trying to meet the functionality requirements resulted in some less than efficient code, which should improve as I gain a better understanding of Godot. I've been struggling especially with the behaviour of the rigidbody nodes. Sometimes when I try to move their position they will snap back to their previous position on the next frame. I plan on sorting that out in the future.
