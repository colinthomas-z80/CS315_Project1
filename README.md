Simple ball throwing game by Colin Thomas

## Project Report
This iteration I was able to spend some time refining some of the game's functionality. Not to say the game is close to being done, because it still lacks a clear objective/challenge, but I thought about the core elements of the game. Instead of having strength represented by a numerical value, I thought it would be more clear just having low, medium, and high strength settings. When I was starting to think of a sound effect to attach to the ball, I ended up playing with Garage Band on my phone for quite awhile making a simple song for the game. I think the music alone makes it a lot more interesting. All this being said, there is a lot of work remaining. There needs to be some element of challenge and variety in hitting the pin. I like the idea of giving it some animated wings and floating around. Reminiscent of those sardonic animations at bowling alleys that mock you for missing the pins.
